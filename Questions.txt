This is a simplified snippet from a live working system which is used by engineers across the Bank for provisioning applications.



Q1. Have a look around the project, though don't get too concerned with the actual implementations.
    Does everything looks ok. If not, suggest improvements.









Q2. The purpose of CSharpTemplate is to apply transformations to the selected app scaffold.
    For example: rename the solution and the project files to the appication's new name,
                 rename namespaces in the projects, apply other user-defined transformations.
    DefaultIgnoreDirs defines what folders are to be ignored during the transformation. However the list is limited,
    and does not meet requirements of all scaffolds.

    You are tasked with making the list is configurable with the configurations to be supplied by each app scaffold.
    Propose a solution.
